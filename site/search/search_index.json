Various storage solutions available to UCT researchers include secure on-site storage, cloud storage, and online repositories. The eResearch Centre encourages the use of UCT-approved and licensed services for the storage of research data. </p> <p>Today, some areas of science are facing hundred- to thousand-fold increases in data volumes, from satellites, telescopes, microscopes, high-throughput instruments, sensor networks, accelerators and supercomputers, compared to the volumes generated only a decade ago. Other research fields also face major data management challenges. In almost every laboratory, \u2018born digital\u2019 data proliferate in files, spreadsheets or databases stored on hard drives, digital notebooks, websites, blogs and wikis. The management, curation and archiving of these digital data are becoming increasingly burdensome for researchers.</p> <p>Moreover, The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) requires the reconsideration of research data storage options to ensure the protection of personal information relating to data subjects.</p>"},{"location":"data/access/","title":"Getting access","text":""},{"location":"data/access/#how-to-request-access-to-the-rds","title":"How to request access to the RDS?","text":"<p>The RDS is a paid service, and you can find details about costs here.

Secure access to your research data is provided via UCT credentials and data can be accessed from anywhere in the world. </p> <p>The data is stored on Dell MD3060 storage arrays, hosted in the highly secure Upper Campus Data Centre.

All recommended repositories will generate a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which is a secure and persistent identifier. This makes it easier for researchers to comply with institutional, NRF and other funder requirements. Once data is uploaded, researchers can assign licenses and control how their research outputs are accessed.</p> <p>Importantly, UCT doesn\u2019t mandate a specific repository, and depending on the discipline, there are various discipline-specific repositories to choose from. UCT\u2019s recommended online repository is ZivaHub, which we offer support and guidance for. ZivaHub (Figshare) is an excellent generalist repository and is suitable for the widest range of data types and formats.  </p> <p>Some funders may require using a specific repository, and other repositories may be more attractive because they are discipline-specific. We recommend using  www.re3data.org, an international registry of research data repositories, to search for a suitable alternative repository.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"hpc/","title":"High performance computing at UCT","text":"<p>Researchers and students can get access to the centrally hosted HPC.</p> <p>Read more about the HPC at https://ucthpc.uct.ac.za/. </p>"},{"location":"hpc/access/","title":"Getting access","text":""},{"location":"hpc/access/#before-applying-for-an-account","title":"Before applying for an account","text":"<p>Sharing of passwords is considered an act of gross misconduct and subject to the application of UCT sanctions.</p> <p>You will need to have an active UCT staff or student account at UCT.
