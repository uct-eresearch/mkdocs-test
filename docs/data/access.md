## How to request access to the RDS?

The RDS is a paid service, and you can find details about costs here. Service and infrastructure costs are linked to eRA Pre-Awards to assist in budgeting for research grant applications.

For further enquiries or to request research data storage, email us or log a request on the ICTS Service Desk.

Documentation for users and prospective users of the RDS can be downloaded here - RDS Documentation V1.2 and Folder Structure and Permissions.
