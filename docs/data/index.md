# Research data storage at UCT

The demands of data-intensive research represent a storage challenge. Various storage solutions available to UCT researchers include secure on-site storage, cloud storage, and online repositories. The eResearch Centre encourages the use of UCT-approved and licensed services for the storage of research data. 

Today, some areas of science are facing hundred- to thousand-fold increases in data volumes, from satellites, telescopes, microscopes, high-throughput instruments, sensor networks, accelerators and supercomputers, compared to the volumes generated only a decade ago. Other research fields also face major data management challenges. In almost every laboratory, ‘born digital’ data proliferate in files, spreadsheets or databases stored on hard drives, digital notebooks, websites, blogs and wikis. The management, curation and archiving of these digital data are becoming increasingly burdensome for researchers.

Moreover, The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) requires the reconsideration of research data storage options to ensure the protection of personal information relating to data subjects.
