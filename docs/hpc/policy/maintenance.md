# Maintenance

ICTS has several data centers across campus and has a maintenance policy for each center. Additionally the HPC team has maintenance tasks that need to be carried out on the firmware, operating system and application software of the HPC nodes.

Most maintenance slots do not require a full shut down of the data centers and your submitted jobs should continue running, however access to the cluster may be limited. If we are aware of a full data center shutdown it will be highlighted on this page, our blog and the dashboards. We will also attempt to contact our users well in advance.
