# Glossary

`Cluster`

:   A group of linked computers, known as nodes, that work together to perform complex computations, aggregating their processing power, memory, and storage to solve demanding tasks. 

`Node`

:    An individual computer within a cluster, typically consisting of one or more sockets, each containing multiple cores. 

`Central Processing Unit (CPU)`

:   The primary processor in a node, though the term can be ambiguous and is sometimes avoided due to potential misunderstandings. 

 

`Core`

:   The smallest unit of computing within a processor, capable of executing instructions; modern processors have multiple cores. 

 

`Thread`

:   A hardware thread allows a single core to execute multiple execution paths in parallel (via Hyperthreading), while software threads allow a single program to run multiple parallel tasks.
