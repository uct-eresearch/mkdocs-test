# Quick Start

## Basic information

The ICTS High Performance Cluster uses SLURM to schedule jobs. There is one head node that researchers login to in order to submit jobs. The `/home` and `/scratch` partitions on the head node are mounted on all worker nodes, regardless of series. 

The head node is called `hpc.uct.ac.za` as well as `hex.uct.ac.za`. These two names can be used interchangeably.
